- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly sync your dotfiles with a GitHub repository.
- **Automatic Profile Detection**: Intelligently select the appropriate profile based on hostname, OS, or environment variables.
- **File Watching**: Automatically sync changes as soon as they occur.
- **Scheduled Syncing**: Set up periodic syncs to ensure your dotfiles are always up-to-date.
- **Symlink Support**: Choose between copying files or creating symlinks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Dotty uses a TOML configuration file located at `~/.config/dotty/config.toml`. Here's an example configuration:

```toml
[remote]
github_repo = "https://github.com/crazywolf132/dotfiles.git"
github_token = "your_github_token"

[profiles.default]
files = { ".bashrc" = "/home/user/.bashrc", ".vimrc" = "/home/user/.vimrc" }
ignore_patterns = [".git", ".gitignore"]
use_symlinks = false

[profile_detection]
[[profile_detection.rules]]
profile = "work"
conditions = [
    { Hostname = "work-laptop" },
    { EnvVar = { name = "WORK_ENV", value = "true" } }
]

[[profile_detection.rules]]
profile = "personal"
conditions = [{ OS = "macos" }]
```
